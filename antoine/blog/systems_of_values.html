<h1 class="title">Systems of values</h1>
</header>
<p>This was written with the help of ChatGPT.</p>
<h1 id="europe"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Europe</h1>
<p>The value of authenticity has deep roots in European culture, and it can be traced back to various philosophical and cultural traditions.</p>
<p>One of the earliest expressions of this value can be found in ancient Greek philosophy. Socrates, for example, emphasized the importance of living an examined life and being true to oneself. He believed that true knowledge and wisdom could only be attained by questioning one’s beliefs and assumptions and seeking the truth.</p>
<p>In the medieval period, Christian thinkers such as Saint Augustine emphasized the importance of inner sincerity and honesty as a means of attaining spiritual salvation. This emphasis on inner authenticity continued to be influential in European culture throughout the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the existentialist movement in philosophy, which originated in Europe, placed a high value on authenticity. Existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger argued that individuals must take responsibility for their lives and make choices based on their own unique experience and understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Today, the value of authenticity is reflected in various aspects of European culture, such as the emphasis on individualism and self-expression in art, music, and fashion. It is also reflected in the European approach to politics, which tends to value transparency, accountability, and social justice.</p>
<h1 id="us"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> US</h1>
<p>The value of popularity and success in American culture can be traced back to various historical and cultural factors.</p>
<p>One of the key factors is the American Dream, which is the idea that anyone can achieve success and prosperity through hard work and determination. This concept has been a driving force in American culture since the early days of the country’s founding, and it has been reinforced by the country’s history of upward mobility and economic growth.</p>
<p>Another factor is the influence of capitalism and the free market system on American culture. The early colonizers were primarily motivated by economic interests, such as finding new sources of natural resources and establishing trade networks with Europe. This focus on economic growth and expansion laid the foundation for the future development of a capitalist economy in America. In the United States, entrepreneurship and innovation are highly valued, and there is a strong emphasis on competition and individual achievement. This has led to a culture that places a high value on financial success and material wealth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the United States has a history of valuing individualism and self-reliance, which has contributed to the idea that success is largely determined by individual effort and ability. This has also contributed to a culture of self-promotion and self-marketing, in which individuals are encouraged to present themselves in the most positive light possible in order to achieve success.</p>
<p>Finally, the media and entertainment industries in the United States play a significant role in shaping cultural values, and they often promote and celebrate success and popularity. The American entertainment industry is known for promoting celebrities and stars, and the media often focuses on stories of successful individuals and their achievements. This has helped to reinforce the idea that popularity and success are highly valued in American culture.</p>
<h1 id="examples"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Examples</h1>
<h2 id="shortage-of-chartreuse"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Shortage of Chartreuse</h2>
<p>The differences between these two systems is sometimes under media spotlight. e.g. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/dining/drinks/chartreuse-shortage.html &quot; Mr. Lutz, the Chartreuse enthusiast in Michigan, is concerned that the liqueur will become the new bourbon, with secondary markets inflating the liqueur’s price many times above its current retail baseline of $64.99 for a 750-milliliter bottle. When a desirable product is scarce, he said, “it’s all tulips and Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>But Frederick Wildman and Chartreuse Diffusion, which doesn’t plan to raise prices to take advantage of soaring demand, stand by the monks’ decision. “Growth for growth’s sake is nonsense for us,” said Emmanuel Delafon, president of Chartreuse Diffusion. &quot; I am great :) Ah too bad ! I am sure after 1 month you’d have kicked our asses !</p>
